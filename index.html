            <h2>Why Chopin?</h2>
            <h3>Why is Chopin my favorite classical music composer?</h3>
            <p>
              Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew
              up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A
              child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his
              earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20,
              less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830
              Uprising. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter - in the last 18
              years of his life - he gave only 30 public performances,
              preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported
              himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons,
              for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with
              Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical
              contemporaries, including Robert Schumann.
